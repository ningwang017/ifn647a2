main coding in a2.py 

tasks: 
• Task 1 – Design an BM25-based IR baseline model (Baseline) that ranks documents in
each dataset using the corresponding queries for all 50 datasets.
• Task 2 – Based on the knowledge you gained from this unit, design two different
models to rank documents in each dataset using corresponding queries from all 50
datasets. You can call them My_model1 and My_model2, respectively.
• Task 3 – Use Python to implement three models: Baseline, My_model1 and
My_model2, and test them on the given data collections of 50 topics and 50 datasets and
print out the top 12 documents for each dataset (put the output in the appendix of your
final report).
• Task 4 – Use three effectiveness measures to display testing results in tables or graphs.
• Task 5 – Recommend the best model based on significance test and your analysis.
